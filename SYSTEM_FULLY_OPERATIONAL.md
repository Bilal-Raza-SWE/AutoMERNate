# 🎉 SYSTEM NOW FULLY FUNCTIONAL!
**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED

---

## ✅ FIXED ISSUES:

### 1. **Product Images Not Loading** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Images showed as broken icons  
**Root Cause:** 
- Product service wasn't serving static files from `/uploads` folder
- API Gateway wasn't proxying `/uploads` requests

**Solution:**
- Added `express.static` middleware to Product Service for `/uploads` folder
- Added proxy route in API Gateway to forward `/uploads` requests to Product Service

**Result:** ✅ All product images now display correctly

---

### 2. **Authentication Not Working** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** 
- "Authentication failed: Token not provided" error
- Cannot login/signup
- Cannot access user profile
- Cannot view orders

**Root Cause:** 
- API Gateway wasn't forwarding cookies between frontend and backend services
- JWT tokens stored in cookies weren't being passed to User/Order services

**Solution:**
- Updated API Gateway proxy configuration for User Service to:
  - Forward cookies from client to service
  - Forward set-cookie headers from service to client
  - Set `cookieDomainRewrite` option
- Applied same fix to Order Service proxy

**Result:** ✅ Authentication now works properly

---

### 3. **MongoDB Connection** ✅ FIXED EARLIER
**Problem:** Services couldn't connect to MongoDB Atlas  
**Solution:** Added IP address to MongoDB Atlas whitelist  
**Result:** ✅ All services connected to database

## 📝 IMPORTANT NOTES:

2. **Services communicate through API Gateway** - Always use http://localhost:3000 for frontend

3. **Keep all 7 PowerShell windows open** - Each service needs its own terminal

4. **MongoDB Atlas IP must be whitelisted** - Already done (182.182.181.122/32)
