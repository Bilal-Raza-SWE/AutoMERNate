# AutoMERNate - Microservices E-Commerce Platform

**Author:** Muhammad Bilal Raza Attari

Welcome to **AutoMERNate**, a fully decentralized, domain-driven microservices e-commerce platform. This project has been converted from a monolithic architecture to a pure microservices system with isolated services communicating through APIs.

## Architecture

AutoMERNate now follows a microservices architecture with the following services:

- **API Gateway**: Routes requests to appropriate services
- **User Service**: Handles user authentication, profiles, and management
- **Product Service**: Manages product catalog, inventory, and reviews
- **Order Service**: Processes orders and shopping cart functionality
- **Payment Service**: Handles payment processing via Razorpay
- **Notification Service**: Sends emails and notifications
- **Frontend**: React-based user interface

Each service has its own database, deployment, and scalability.

## Features

- **Full-Featured Shopping Cart**: Seamless shopping cart functionality for users to add, remove, and manage products.
- **Product Reviews and Ratings**: Users can leave reviews and provide ratings for products.
- **Top Products Carousel**: Display a carousel of top-rated or featured products.
- **Product Pagination**: Navigate through products efficiently with pagination.
- **Product Search Feature**: Easily search for products based on keywords.
- **User Profile with Orders**: Users can create profiles and track their order history.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Comprehensive dashboard for administrators to manage admins, products, users, and orders.
- **Admin Admin Management**: Manage admin accounts.
- **Admin Product Management**: Add, edit, and delete products from the platform.
- **Admin User Management**: Manage user accounts.
- **Admin Order Details Page**: Access detailed information about each order.
- **Mark Orders as Delivered Option**: Ability to update order status to "delivered."
- **Checkout Process**: Seamless checkout with options for shipping and payment methods.
- **Razorpay Integration**: Secure payment processing through Razorpay.
- **Database Seeder**: Easily populate the database with sample products and users.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **MongoDB** - Either local installation or MongoDB Atlas account
- **Git** - For cloning the repository
- **Razorpay Account** - For payment integration ([Sign up](https://razorpay.com/))
- **Gmail Account** - For email services with App Password enabled

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bilal-Raza-SWE/automernate.git
cd automernate
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

Install dependencies for each service:

```bash
# API Gateway
cd services/api-gateway
npm install
cd ../..

# User Service
cd services/user-service
npm install
cd ../..

# Product Service
cd services/product-service
npm install
cd ../..

npm install
cd ../..

# Notification Service
cd services/notification-service
npm install
cd ../..

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

Create `.env` files in each service directory based on the provided examples.

For microservices mode, use `docker-compose-microservices.yml`.

```dotenv
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=your_strong_jwt_secret_here
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/automernate
# Or for MongoDB Atlas: mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/automernate

RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_key_secret
PAGINATION_LIMIT=8

# Gmail SMTP Configuration
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_16_char_app_password
EMAIL_FROM=<noreply@automernate.com>
```

**Note:** To get Gmail App Password:
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication in your Google Account
2. Go to [https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
3. Create new app password for "Mail"
4. Copy the 16-character password and use it in EMAIL_PASS

4. **Seed the Database (Optional)**

Populate the database with sample products and users:
```bash
npm run data:import
```

To destroy all data:
```bash
npm run data:destroy
```

### Running the Application

**Microservices Mode** (recommended):
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-microservices.yml up --build
```

**Monolithic Mode** (legacy):
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The application will be available at:
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- API Gateway: `http://localhost:5000`

### Data Migration

To migrate data from monolithic to microservices:
```bash
cd data-migration
npm install
npm run migrate
```

This will install all dependencies and create an optimized production build of the frontend.

## Default Login Credentials

After seeding the database, you can use these credentials:
# Import data
npm run data:import

# Destroy data
npm run data:destroy
```

## Sample User Logins
